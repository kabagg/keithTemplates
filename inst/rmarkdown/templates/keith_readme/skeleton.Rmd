# Overview

What is this project about?
Who is the PI?
What is the hypothesis?
What data do we have/are we collecting?

# Results

As new results are obtained from 
smaller scripts in R/, add links
to those interim scripts and
md files here.

# Workflow

Point users to the Makefile
or to the R scripts they should
invoke to produce the results
we obtained.

# Libraries

Every time we add a new script
to R/, update this list of
libraries to include new ones
used that we didn't have already.
